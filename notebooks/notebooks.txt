Key Structural Improvements:
Clear Separation - Each major thought process is in a markdown cell, followed by the corresponding code cells

Logical Flow - Each notebook builds naturally on the previous one

Comprehensive Documentation - Extensive comments and thinking process explanations

Business Context - Every analysis step connects back to business implications

Professional Presentation - Executive-ready visualizations and summaries

Notebook Progression:
Notebook 1: Data Wrangling - Raw data to clean time series

Notebook 2: EDA - Understanding patterns and informing model selection

Notebook 3: Model Building - Developing and comparing forecasting approaches

Notebook 4: Forecasting - Production deployment and business insights

Each notebook can be run independently (with dependencies on previous outputs) and tells a complete story of that phase of the analysis. The chain of thought is clearly documented throughout, making it easy to understand the analytical reasoning behind each decision.
